s3-delete-bucket.py - Simple python script for deleting a whole Amazon S3 bucket recursively. 

Requirements: Amazon S3 Library for REST in Python available at
              http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=134

Installation: Download S3 Library from URL above. Unzip, then copy
              S3.py into the directory where s3-delete-bucket.py resides.

Usage: 

  Set the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to your values. Example:

  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<insert your aws access key here>"
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<insert your secret aws access key here>"

  ..then run:

  python s3-delete-bucket.py <bucket name>

  ..this will not actually delete anything, only list the number of
  objects in the bucket, or give an error message if the bucket
  doesn't exist or if you can't access it.

  To actually delete all contents of the bucket, then delete the bucket itself, run:

  ACTUALLY_DELETE=1 python s3-delete-bucket.py <bucket name>

  ..that will remove all objects in the bucket, then remove the
  bucket. Some progress information is printed during the
  operation. For buckets with many objects, the script will take a
  while to complete.
